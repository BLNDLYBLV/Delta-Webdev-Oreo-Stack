# Delta-Webdev-Oreo-Stack

> Welcome to the oreo maker page
> Basically if you enter 'o' in the box the biscuit part of the oreo is printed
> And, if you enter 're' in the box the cream part of the oreo is printed
> So, you can enter 'o' and 're' in any order and a stack for that is prepared and printed
> Clicking the 'add new cookie' btn will create a new stack to be controlled
> Once you have a stack you can move it around by clicking and dragging the stack
> It is not visible but if you click the right bottom corner and move, the stack's size also changes accordingly
> <strong> And if you are using firefox please increase your screen size to 120%-130% for better experience</strong>
